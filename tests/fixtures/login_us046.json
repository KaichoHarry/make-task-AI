        "The clocking function is only available to authenticated users.",
        "Clocking types consist of four types: 'Clock-in', 'Clock-out', 'Break-start', and 'Break-end'.",
        "The user_id must be linked at the time of clocking.",
        "Clocking is not possible with a non-existent user ID.",
        "Server time is used for the clocking timestamp (client-side time is not trusted).",
        "Consecutive recording of the same type is prohibited (e.g., Clock-in followed by Clock-in is not allowed).",
        "Clocking out is not possible before clocking in.",
        "Clocking a break-end is not possible before a break-start.",
        "Clocking data is managed on a per-day basis.",
        "Clocking data is saved within a transaction.",
        "Rollback is performed if clocking fails.",
        "Clocking history cannot be deleted (for auditing purposes).",
        "Modifying clocking records is only possible with administrator authority.",
        "Timestamps before and after changes are saved in the history upon modification.",

        "Parameterized queries are used as SQL injection countermeasures.",
        "Input values are sanitized (Anti-XSS).",
        "HTTPS communication is mandatory.",
        "The IP address is recorded at the time of clocking.",
        "Device information (User-Agent) is recorded at the time of clocking.",
        "Unnatural clocking patterns (e.g., mass clocking in a short time) are subject to detection.",
        "Abnormal clocking is subject to alerts.",
        "Successful clocking logs are stored.",
        "Failed clocking logs are stored.",
        "Clocking data can be integrated with the payroll system.",
        "External integration requires API token authentication.",
        "Clocking data can be exported in CSV format.",
        "Export operations are subject to permission control.",
        "Concurrent update conflicts are detected via optimistic locking.",
        "Update fails when a conflict occurs.",
        "Clocking data can be aggregated on a monthly basis.",
        "Aggregation processing is executed by batch jobs.",
