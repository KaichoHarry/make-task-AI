            "The system shall restrict access to backup configuration and restoration functions exclusively to users with 'Administrator' privileges.",
            "The system must allow the definition of backup targets, including databases, files, and configuration settings.",
            "The system shall support automated backup scheduling with configurable intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) and allow manual execution.",
            "The system must encrypt backup data at rest and enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) for all data transfer to ensure security.",
            "The system shall support storing backup data in a geographically separate storage region for disaster recovery purposes.",
            "The system must perform integrity checks on backup data and automatically detect and alert on corruption.",
            "The system shall enforce a configurable retention policy and automatically delete obsolete backups.",
            "The system must ensure that backup operations are performed without stopping system services (online backup) and with minimal impact on performance.",
            "The system shall support Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) functionality, allowing restoration to a specific timestamp.",
            "The system must guarantee transactional consistency during the restoration process and verify data integrity post-restoration.",
            "The system shall require a confirmation step before executing a restore operation to prevent accidental data overwrites.",
            "The system must support failover mechanisms to switch operations to a standby environment in case of primary failure.",
            "The system shall send notifications to administrators via email or system integration in the event of a backup failure.",
            "The system must generate immutable audit logs for all backup executions, configuration changes, restoration attempts, and failover operations.",
            "The system shall store audit logs in tamper-evident storage to prevent modification.",
            "The system must restrict direct access to backup storage and enforce a least-privilege access policy.",
            "The system shall support periodic restore testing and record the results for compliance.",
            "The system must implement tamper detection mechanisms for stored backup data.",
            "The backup API must require authentication, enforce rate limiting, and strictly hide internal system details in responses.",
            "The system shall target defined RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) metrics for recovery operations."
