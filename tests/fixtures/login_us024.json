            "The system shall control the availability of UI elements and menu data based on the user's assigned permissions.",
            "The system must support data scope restrictions, such as limiting access to data within the user's own department (Row-Level Security).",
            "The system shall allow a single user to be assigned multiple roles and apply configurable priority rules to resolve conflicts.",
            "The system must apply permission changes immediately and enforce re-authentication or token revocation for active users.",
            "The system shall enforce a 'Default Deny' policy, blocking access to any function or resource not explicitly permitted.",
            "The system must return an HTTP 403 Forbidden status for any unauthorized access attempts.",
            "The system shall perform all authorization checks on the backend server to ensure security, regardless of client-side validation.",
            "The system must implement caching for permission data and automatically invalidate the cache upon configuration changes.",
            "The system shall maintain a comprehensive history of permission changes, including pre-modification and post-modification values and the modifier's User ID.",
            "The system must support logical deletion of roles and prevent the assignment of deleted roles to users.",
            "The system shall generate an immutable audit log for every permission change event and store it in tamper-evident storage.",
            "The system must use parameterized queries and input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.",
            "The system shall enforce strict authentication and rate limiting for all API access points.",
            "The system must encrypt stored permission configurations and enforce authentication for internal inter-system communications.",

            "The system must support exporting and importing permission configurations to facilitate backup and migration.",
