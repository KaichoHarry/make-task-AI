            "The system shall allow only authenticated users to view the dashboard.",

            "The system must require the specification of a display period (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Custom) and return an error if missing.",
            "The system shall aggregate data automatically from the database while guaranteeing transactional consistency.",
            "The system must exclude logically deleted records from the aggregation scope.",
            "The system shall support real-time data updates via WebSocket or polling, strictly validating authentication tokens.",
            "The system must implement a caching mechanism to reduce database load, automatically invalidating cache upon data updates.",
            "The system shall allow users to toggle between different graph visualization formats (Bar, Line, Pie).",
            "The system must support exporting dashboard data to CSV and Excel formats.",

            "The API must adhere to REST architectural principles, support versioning, and must not expose internal system details in responses.",
            "The system shall display user-friendly error messages while logging detailed error stacks internally.",
            "The system must generate an access log for every dashboard view, capturing User ID, Timestamp, and Dashboard ID.",

            "The system shall allow administration of dashboard templates and retain a history of template modifications.",
            "The system must be designed to support horizontal scaling (scale-out) to handle increased concurrent access.",
            "The system shall target an API response time of under 500ms for data retrieval (excluding heavy aggregation tasks)."
