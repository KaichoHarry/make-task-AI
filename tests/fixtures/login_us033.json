            "The system shall allow only authenticated users to execute report generation.",
            "The system must restrict report viewing privileges based on user roles.",
            "The system shall require the specification of a target period (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) and return an error if missing.",
            "The system must aggregate data automatically from the database while guaranteeing transactional consistency.",
            "The system shall exclude logically deleted records from the aggregation scope.",
            "The system must support output in PDF, CSV, and Excel formats.",
            "The system shall store generated files in temporary encrypted storage and provide access via time-limited signed URLs.",
            "The system must automatically generate unique filenames and invalidate access URLs upon expiration.",
            "The system shall maintain a generation history log including Creator ID, Timestamp, and Target Period.",
            "The system must process requests asynchronously via a job queue to handle high concurrency.",
            "The system shall return a Job ID immediately upon request and provide an endpoint to check job status.",

            "The system must allow administration of report templates and retain a history of template modifications.",
            "The system shall enforce a configurable file size limit and a timeout limit, failing processes that exceed these bounds.",
            "The system must execute long-running aggregations using split processing to avoid timeouts.",
            "The system shall target an API response time of under 500ms for the initial job creation request.",
