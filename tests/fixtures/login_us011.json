            "The system shall allow only authenticated users to access the search functionality.",

            "The system must support partial match (LIKE), exact match, numeric range, and date range search queries.",
            "The system shall allow users to combine multiple search conditions using logical AND and OR operators.",
            "The system must provide sorting functionality and pagination with a configurable limit per page (e.g., max 100 items).",
            "The system shall prevent unrestricted full-table retrieval if specific search criteria are missing.",

            "The system must enforce rate limiting and restrict wildcard usage to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) and high load.",
            "The system shall implement caching for identical queries, ensuring the cache is invalidated upon data update.",
            "The system must generate an immutable audit log for every search operation, capturing User ID, criteria, and timestamp.",
            "The system shall return an HTTP 400 error for invalid parameters and must not expose internal database error details.",
