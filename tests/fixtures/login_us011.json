    "action": "I want to quickly and accurately search for necessary information among large volumes of business data",
    "reason": "Because business efficiency drops significantly if I cannot access required data immediately",
    "acceptance_criteria": [
        "The search function is only available to authenticated users.",
        "The searchable data range is restricted according to the user's role (Row-Level Access Control).",
        "Multiple fields (e.g., Name, ID, Email, Date, Status, etc.) can be specified as search targets.",
        "Partial match search (LIKE search) is supported.",
        "Exact match search is supported.",
        "Numeric range search (e.g., Amount, ID range) is supported.",
        "Date range search is supported.",
        "Multiple condition AND search is possible.",
        "Multiple condition OR search is possible.",
        "Sorting functionality (ascending/descending) is provided.",
        "Pagination functionality (limit/offset) is implemented.",
        "The maximum number of items per page is configurable (e.g., 100 items).",
        "Parameterized queries are used as a countermeasure against SQL injection.",
        "Input values are sanitized (Anti-XSS).",
        "There is a control to prevent fetching all records if search conditions are not entered.",
        "Indexes are set on primary search fields.",
        "Search functions even in large-scale data environments (1 million+ records).",
        "Target response time for the search API is within 500ms.",
        "Rate limiting is applied (Anti-DoS).",
        "Search operation logs are stored (user_id, search conditions, timestamp).",
        "Unauthorized data is not included in the search results.",
        "The search API is REST-compliant.",
        "API responses are in JSON format.",
        "Detailed DB errors are not returned during internal errors.",
        "A caching mechanism is available (speeding up repeated searches with the same conditions).",
        "The cache is invalidated when data is updated.",
        "Load control during concurrent high-volume requests is implemented.",
        "A separate permission is required for the search result export function.",
        "Invalid search parameters return a 400 error.",
        "API versioning is managed.",
        "UTF-8 character encoding is supported.",
        "Permission verification is performed on the backend as well as the frontend.",
        "There is a maximum character limit for search conditions.",
        "Controls are implemented to prevent load increases due to excessive use of wildcards.",
        "A limit is set on the number of filter condition combinations.",
        "Audit logs are stored in tamper-evident storage.",
        "The design anticipates future integration with a full-text search engine."
