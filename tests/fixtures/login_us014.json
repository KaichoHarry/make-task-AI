        "The log retention period is configurable (e.g., 5 years).",
        "Audit logs must be searchable.",
        "Searching by date range is possible.",
        "Searching by User ID is possible.",
        "Searching by operation type is possible.",
        "Searching by target resource ID is possible.",
        "Search results must support pagination.",

        "--- Additional Security & Traceability Enhancements ---",
        "Each log entry must include a digital signature to verify integrity and prevent post-hoc tampering.",
        "Implement a 'Correlation ID' to trace a single user request across multiple distributed services in the logs.",
        "Access to the audit logs themselves (who viewed which logs) must be recorded as a 'meta-audit log'."
