            "The system shall allow only authenticated users with the 'Employee' role to use the clock-in function.",
            "The system must support distinct clocking types: 'Clock-In' and 'Clock-Out'.",
            "The system shall enforce the sequence of 'Clock-In' followed by 'Clock-Out', preventing consecutive Clock-Ins or Clock-Out without a preceding Clock-In.",
            "The system must return an error if a user attempts to 'Clock-In' while the current status is already 'Clocked-In'.",
            "The system shall use the server timestamp for all records, disregarding client-side time, and respect the configured corporate time zone.",
            "The system must record User ID, Timestamp, Type, Device Info, and IP Address for every clocking transaction.",
            "The system shall store clocking data as immutable logs to prevent tampering.",
            "The system must restrict data modification capabilities exclusively to 'Administrator' roles, prohibiting general users from editing records.",
            "The system shall maintain a comprehensive modification history, including the original data, modified values, reason for change, and the modifier.",
            "The system must automatically calculate daily working hours and trigger alerts if statutory limits are exceeded.",
            "The system shall log a warning if continuous working hours exceed a pre-configured threshold.",
            "The system must support configurable automatic break deduction rules as well as manual 'Break-Start' and 'Break-End' clocking.",
            "The system shall support clocking via both Web and Mobile interfaces, with the ability to record GPS location data for mobile requests.",
            "The system must flag clocking attempts made from outside permitted geographical areas (geofencing) as warnings.",
            "The system shall detect and alert on suspicious patterns, such as extremely short intervals (e.g., < 1 minute) between clock-in and clock-out.",
            "The system must limit concurrent login sessions and reject simultaneous clocking attempts from multiple locations for the same account.",
            "The system shall enforce rate limiting, HTTPS (TLS 1.2+), and CSRF protection for all clocking APIs.",
            "The system must utilize an ORM or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and sanitize all inputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
            "The system shall restrict users to viewing only their own attendance history, while allowing Administrators to access history for all employees.",
            "The system must support data integration with payroll systems and enable CSV export functionality.",
            "The system shall implement logical deletion for data and adhere to configurable data retention policies.",
            "The system must target an API response time of under 300ms and follow REST architectural principles.",
            "The system shall store audit logs in tamper-evident storage to ensure data integrity."
