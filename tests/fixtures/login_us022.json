            "The system shall restrict access to monitoring configurations exclusively to authenticated users with 'Administrator' privileges.",
            "The system must support the definition of monitoring targets including Servers, Databases, APIs, and Batch processes.",
            "The system shall execute periodic health checks and trigger immediate alerts upon failure detection.",
            "The system must monitor system resource metrics such as CPU usage, Memory usage, Disk space, and Network latency.",
            "The system shall track application performance metrics including API response times, Database connection counts, and Error rates.",
            "The system must allow administrators to configure specific alert thresholds for all monitored metrics.",
            "The system shall implement alert deduplication mechanisms to prevent notification storms.",
            "The system must support notification delivery via Email, Chat integration, and external monitoring systems, with automatic retries on failure.",
            "The system shall store monitoring data as time-series records with a configurable retention period.",
            "The system must provide a dashboard with graphing capabilities to visualize metrics and current system status.",
            "The system shall maintain a comprehensive alert history and support 'Acknowledge' and 'Close' workflows with incident resolution logging.",
            "The system must generate immutable audit logs for any modifications to monitoring configurations.",
            "The system shall store audit logs and critical monitoring data in tamper-evident storage.",
            "The system must enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) and strict authentication for the monitoring API, applying rate limiting to prevent abuse.",
            "The system shall be designed to operate with minimal performance overhead on the monitored environment.",
            "The system must utilize a redundant architecture to ensure monitoring continuity even during server failures.",
            "The system shall implement self-monitoring capabilities to detect failures within the monitoring service itself.",
            "The system must support configurable escalation rules and notification schedules (e.g., night/holiday shifts).",
            "The system shall generate automated reports when Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations are detected.",
            "The system must target an API response time of under 1 second for retrieving monitoring data."
