            "The system shall restrict access to batch job configuration and execution functions exclusively to authenticated users with 'Administrator' privileges.",
            "The system must allow the registration of various job types including data aggregation, notifications, and system integration.",
            "The system shall automatically generate a globally unique Job ID for each registered task.",
            "The system must support flexible scheduling options including specific times, daily, weekly, and monthly intervals, as well as Cron expressions.",
            "The system shall provide a mechanism to manually trigger the execution of registered jobs.",
            "The system must maintain real-time status tracking for all jobs, distinguishing between Pending, Running, Success, and Failure states.",
            "The system shall record start times, end times, and duration for every job execution in a history log.",
            "The system must store execution logs and error logs in tamper-evident storage to prevent modification.",
            "The system shall implement an automatic retry mechanism with a configurable retry count for failed jobs.",
            "The system must trigger an alert notification if a job fails after exhausting the maximum number of retries.",
            "The system shall implement a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent execution of duplicate job instances.",
            "The system must support the definition of job dependencies, ensuring dependent jobs do not start if the prerequisite job fails.",
            "The system shall execute database updates within transactions to ensure data consistency.",
            "The system must use parameterized queries for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection.",
            "The system shall enforce configurable timeout settings for jobs and process long-running tasks asynchronously.",
            "The system must monitor system resource usage (CPU, Memory) and throttle or pause jobs to prevent impact on the production environment.",
            "The system shall utilize a persistent job queue and provide monitoring capabilities for queue depth and latency.",
            "The system must support a redundant architecture to ensure high availability and allow job recovery in case of server failure.",
            "The system shall generate immutable audit logs for all job configuration changes and deletions.",
            "The system must support logical deletion for jobs and retain a history of deleted configurations.",
            "The system shall provide a RESTful API for job management that enforces strict authentication, rate limiting, and input validation.",
            "The system must not expose internal error details or stack traces in API responses.",
            "The system shall provide a dashboard to monitor job success rates and generate statistical reports on batch performance.",
            "The system must allow searching of execution history and support configurable data retention policies.",
            "The system shall be designed to guarantee zero job loss even under high load conditions."
