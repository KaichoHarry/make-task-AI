            "The system shall allow only authenticated users to receive notifications and restrict viewing privileges based on user roles.",
            "The system must automatically generate notifications upon system events, distinguishing by Type (Error/Warning/Info) and Severity (Low/Medium/High/Critical).",
            "The system shall ensure immediate delivery processing for events classified as 'Critical'.",
            "The system must persistently store notifications in the database with Event ID, Timestamp, Type, and Severity.",

            "The system shall support email delivery based on user preferences and providing capabilities for push notification APIs.",

            "The system shall enforce rate limiting to prevent notification spam and overload.",
            "The system must use parameterized queries and input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.",

            "The system shall support logical deletion of notifications and record the deletion history in the audit log.",
            "The system must store notification logs and audit trails in tamper-evident storage.",
            "The system shall automatically generate alerts when monitored events violate defined Service Level Agreements (SLA).",
            "The API must adhere to REST principles, support versioning, enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+), and target a response time of under 500ms for generation."
